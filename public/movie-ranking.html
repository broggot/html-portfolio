<h1>Brody's Favorite Movies!</h1>
<h2>movies of '23</h2>

<hr/>

<h2>The Mother</h2>
<p>This movie really resonated to me, it's about a mother protecting her daughter.</p>
 <h2>The Super Mario Movie</h2>
 <p>What a throwback! i love the nostalgia from this movie & how modern they made it feel.</p>
 <h2>Scream VI</h2>
 <p>I enjoyed this movie because who doesnt like a silly slasher where you dont know who's gonna die first.</p>
 <h2>Adam Driver 65</h2>
 <p>Space movies never go wrong in my book, to think this can happen in the future is insane! wasnt the best space movie but i mean it was ok.</p>
